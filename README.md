Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that scans container images for operating system and programming language package vulnerabilities based on CVEs.

The Jenkins plugin leverages the Amazon Inspector SBOM Generator binary and Amazon Inspector Scan API to produce detailed reports at the end of your build, so you can investigate and remediate risk before deployment.

Using the Amazon Inspector Jenkins plugin, you can add Amazon Inspector vulnerability scans to your Jenkins pipeline.
